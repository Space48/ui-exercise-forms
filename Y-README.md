## Start
 I have spend the first  5 minutes to understanding the problem, then going through the documentation to know what the prerequisite, to spin the server and the client(which I am glad I didnâ€™t spend much time on it as I managed to spin it from the first time)
Run the server successfully

Run the client successfully


![Alt text](src/asset/client.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

Reading the documentation
Checking the repo structure 
Noticing the json data file

## Flow
Writing HTML 
Writing classes and id for tags
Creating css file 
Linkeing css file and test it its linked to index.html

Creating script tag for my js logic
Positioning the js script tag at the bottom for the html tree to prevent of blocking the page of loading if any error happened with js script
 <script src="index.js"></script>
(another way I can add it into the header to with defer ) like:

<script src="index.js" defer></script>

Calling html tag into my js file and console log then to test them 
Writing logic and testing

Writing media query , I chosen break point of max -width of 600
```@media screen and (max-width: 600px)```

## improvement
I would ask for the onclick button to reveal the instruction, would it stay revealed or toggle in between hide and reveal when user click again
In the sample the little arrow to reveal instruction is quite small and hidden in between the question mark.

On the revealed text the Register page should be anchor tag where it take the user to the registration page
The tel number should be clickable where the user can immediately make a call if they wish, to enhance the user experience 
 Making the cursor pointer on hover on any clickable  tag

```<br> Service Team on <a href="tel:0339000094">0339000094</number>```

The instruction text its not clear and there are some mistake, user is already confuse when they are in the resetting page so clease well writer instruction definitely will improve the user experience

Please note all the improvement point I have taken then into counter while solving the problem so they are in the solution as how I explained to improve

## For more time

I would enhance the user experience by adding more compatible color and write more logic to validate the user input(email) and add  layer of  security on the user input
and add more break points from media query for more devices

## over all I really enjoied solving the problem
plese note I have spent about an hour apart of writing this read me
thnaks
