          We have had some customer who mistakenly believe they <br>have a store account when in fact they are only
          signed up<br> to recive our VIP Club newsletter.<br><br>
          If you receive our newsletter but have never made a <br>purchase online this might apply to you, the best way
          to<br> check this is to do the following:<br><br>
          <b>1. Go back to the <a href="/registeration">Register page</a></b><br>
          <b>2. Register with your email address</b><br><br>
          if you already have an account the form will tell you<br>
          if the form tells you, that you already have an account and the<br> password rest doesn't work, please contact
          the
          Customer<br> Service Team on <a href="tel:0339000094">0339000094</number>
        </p>
