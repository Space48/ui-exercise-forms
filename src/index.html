        <p>We have had some customers who mistakenly believe they have a store account when in fact they are only signed up to receive our VIP Club newsletter.</p>

        <p>If you receive our newsletter but have never made a purchase online this might apply to you, the best way to check this is to do the following:</p>

        <ol class="form__reset-help-text__list">
          <li>Go back to the <a href="#" class="form__reset-help-text__list__register">register page</a></li>
          <li>Register with your email address <br/>
            <i>If you do already have an account the form will tell you</i>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>If the form tells you that you already have an account and the password reset doesn't work please contact the Customer Service Team on 033 900 0094</p>
