            <p>If you recieve our newsletter but have never made a purchase online this might apply to you, the best way to check this is to do the following;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>1. Go back to the <a href="/">register page</a></li>
              <li>2. Register with your email address<br/><small>If you do already have an account the form will tell you</small></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the form tells you you already have an account and the password reset doesn't work please contact the Customer Service Team on 033 900 0094
